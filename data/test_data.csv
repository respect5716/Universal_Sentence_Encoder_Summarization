The Kop end - Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead.///He only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry.///But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business.///By business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parry's mission.///Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez.///And his enthusiasm for the Spaniard's personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold.///Benitez's early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead.///But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations.///This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...///Captain Gerrard is central to Liverpool's plans and Parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent.///As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.///In terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004.///Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan.///Morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium.///BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.///Morgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his 짙70m offer.///He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool.///Morgan will certainly not be making another call.///So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield.///Parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpool's future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea.///He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.///Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool's thinking.///Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal's stunning 짙100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.///Parry labelled the deal ""an eye-opener"" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities.///He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'Anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.///I would take 짙50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.///As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?///짙50m for Gerrard?///I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.///We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality.///Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.///Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard.///Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.///I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.///짙50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it.///I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over 짙35m.///Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.///Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.///I would keep Gerrard.///No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.///The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.///Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell.///The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.",Parry relishes Anfield challenge

or clients.///There are now many different types of P2P systems than work in different ways.///P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.///The BBC has already decided to embrace the technology.///It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them.///The files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control.///But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many.///The global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day.///Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content.///Sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week.///But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.///There are several money-spinning models that could turn P2P into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies.///Paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.///""We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,"" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.///""Consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,"" agreed Mr Morgenstern.///But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.///Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.///""Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,"" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft.///""They will probably play an increasing role in helping P2P spread,"" he said.///Looking into P2P's future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned.///""Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,"" he said.///""File-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.""",Peer-to-peer nets 'here to stay'
