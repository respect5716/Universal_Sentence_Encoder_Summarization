business_481,Christmas sales worst since 1981,"UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.///Retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.///The ONS revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in November to 3.2%.///A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December.///Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.///The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.///The ONS echoed an earlier caution from Bank of England governor Mervyn King not to read too much into the poor December figures.///Some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003.///The November-December jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s.///And figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending, an indication that consumers are looking for bargains, and retailers are cutting their prices.///However, reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector.///Morrisons, Woolworths, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and Big Food all said that the festive period was disappointing.///And a British Retail Consortium survey found that Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years.///Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year.///Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.///""The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter,"" said Mr Shaw.///""Our view is the Bank of England will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.""",11011100000001010

sport_354,O'Sullivan keeps his powder dry,"When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.///Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's Six Nations Championship.///He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year.///That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season.///It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League.///We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday.///But, like O'Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it.///The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts.///Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O'Sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign.///But I doubt whether O'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players.///He is not that sort of person.///However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.///But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game.///Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season.///A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948.///With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed.///But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman.///Under the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled.///Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle.///They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland's history.///What happened in 1986?///Whitewashed.///You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized.///Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary.///It is the nature of the beast.///But O'Sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season.///After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder.///O'Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come.///He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed.///Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.",010100100001010001100000011111

entertainment_326,Oscars steer clear of controversy,"The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.///If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ.///Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (짙196m) in the US alone.///But this year's Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.///Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.///Moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International.///But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore's film does not sit well with the Academy.///""If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures.///Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to that category.///""They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said.///While he said the Oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" Moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.///""I think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,"" he said.///The problem with Mel Gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.///""Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said.///But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations.///The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category.///The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster.///But Mr Dams said: ""It's not an inflammatory film.///It has done very well in Germany, and it's a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.""///Another 'contentious' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.///Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.///The film has been a hit around the world.///Mr Dams said: ""It's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced.///""Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy.///It's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views.///""While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm.""///Dam's pick at this year's Oscars?///The Aviator, Martin Scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes.///Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.",11000000011011010111011000000
tech_086,Warning over Windows Word files,"Writing a Microsoft Word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm Workshare.///Up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed, a survey by the firm revealed.///To make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking.///The report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.///Sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said Andrew Pearson, European boss of Workshare which commissioned the research.///""The efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,"" he said.///The problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using Microsoft Word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes.///As documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents.///Poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits.///Microsoft, however, does provide an add-on tool for Windows PCs that fixes the problem.///""The Remove Hidden Data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your Microsoft Office application,"" says the instructions on Microsoft's website.///Microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any Word document.///A tool for Apple machines running Word is not available.///Workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category.///Often, said Mr Pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.///However, the way that Windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved.///Few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed.///The discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if, for instance, those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated.///The research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft.///Problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said Mr Pearson.",11001011000101001000

business_020,Call centre users 'lose patience',"Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.///Once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music.///The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.///""Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,"" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey.///However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.///When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait.///One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.///The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks.///""Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,"" Ms Diemont says.///Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.///In what Dimension Data calls an ""alarming development"", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving ""agents not equipped to deal with customers"".///This, Ms Diemont warns, is ""scary"" and not good for the bottom line either.///Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers.///As a result, call centres have a high ""churn rate"", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.///Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%.///When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.///Suggestions that ""outsourcing"" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.///There are ""no big differences in wait time and call resolution"" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.///""You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,"" she says.///However, companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations.///Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations.///Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money.///But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution.///Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres.///They give three key reasons for not making the move:///- call centre operations are part of their business ""core function"",/// - they are worried about the risk of going abroad,/// - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive.///The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents.///What are your experiences with call centres?///Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response?///And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?",10101001001011001100000000001101

business_329,House prices drop as sales slow,"House prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.///A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years.///Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor.///The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties.///""The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said.///""The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.""///The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market.///On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing.///The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than 짙600 from 짙190,329 in November to 짙189,733 in December.///Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate.///In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more ""moderate"", RICS added.///But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels.///""Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,"" Mr Perry added.///Looking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the market picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over the coming 12 months.",11001000111000
tech_131,Seamen sail into biometric future,"The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.///As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport.///Along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new Seafarers' Identity Document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints.///The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003.///Tests currently under way in the Caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards.///Results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) by the end of November.///Crystal Cruises, which operates the Crystal Harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.///Authenti-corp, the US technology consultancy, has been working with the ILO on its technical specifications for the cards.///""If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,"" Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBC's Go Digital programme.///She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention.///It aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea.///The convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans.///""By increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,"" said Ms Musselman.///""It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.""",11010000110001
